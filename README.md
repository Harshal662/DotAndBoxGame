This is a Project for Design And Analysis of Algorithm Subject.


Dots and Boxes is a pencil-and-paper game for two players. For CP we tried to make this a AI based game, where the player competes against computer. Here as a input we take the number of rows and columns from the user and also ask for the level of difficulty they would like to play on. The game start with a grid of justified dimension with some random score assigned to each block. 

The winner is decided on the value of total score. Here, is the total score is in negative the AI/ Computer wins else the player wins. The algorithm that we used over here is minimax Algorithm and Alpha- beta pruning.
